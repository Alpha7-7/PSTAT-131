## Resampling

For this assignment, we will continue working with part of a [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) that was the subject of a machine learning competition and is often used for practicing ML models. The goal is classification; specifically, to predict which passengers would survive the [Titanic shipwreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic).

Load the data from `data/titanic.csv` into *R* and familiarize yourself with the variables it contains using the codebook (`data/titanic_codebook.txt`).

Notice that `survived` and `pclass` should be changed to factors. When changing `survived` to a factor, you may want to reorder the factor so that *"Yes"* is the first level.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*

Create a recipe for this dataset **identical** to the recipe you used in Homework 3.

### Question 1

Split the data, stratifying on the outcome variable, `survived.`  You should choose the proportions to split the data into. Verify that the training and testing data sets have the appropriate number of observations. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(ISLR) 
library(ISLR2) 
library(discrim)
library(poissonreg)
library(corrr)
library(klaR)
tidymodels_prefer()
library(ggplot2)
titanic <- arrange(titanic, desc(survived)) 
titanic$survived <- factor(titanic$survived)
titanic$pclass <- factor(titanic$pclass)

set.seed(1222)
titanic_split <- initial_split(titanic, prop = 0.80,
                                strata = survived)
titanic_train <- training(titanic_split)
titanic_test <- testing(titanic_split)
titanic_train

```
```{r}
dim(titanic_train)
dim(titanic_test)
```

### Question 2
Fold the **training** data. Use *k*-fold cross-validation, with $k = 10$.
```{r}
titanic_recipe <- recipe(survived ~pclass+sex+age+sib_sp+parch+fare, data = titanic_train) %>% 
  step_impute_linear(age, impute_with =  imp_vars(all_predictors())) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_interact(terms = ~ sex:fare) %>%
  step_interact(terms = ~ age:fare) 
```


```{r}
titanic_folds <- vfold_cv(titanic_train, v = 10)
titanic_folds
```
```{r}
degree_grid <- grid_regular(degree(range = c(1, 10)), levels = 10)
degree_grid
```

### Question 3

In your own words, explain what we are doing in Question 2. What is *k*-fold cross-validation? Why should we use it, rather than simply fitting and testing models on the entire training set? If we **did** use the entire training set, what resampling method would that be?

It ensures that every observation from the dataset has the chance of appearing in both training and testing set. If we use the stratified training data that there could be a probability that the training set could have really low MSE, however the testing set has a high MSE. If we did use the entire training set then we would be using the leave one out cross validation (LOOCV), where a single observation is held out for validation. 

### Question 4

Set up workflows for 3 models:
1. A logistic regression with the `glm` engine;
2. A linear discriminant analysis with the `MASS` engine;
3. A quadratic discriminant analysis with the `MASS` engine.
```{r}
log_reg <- logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")
log_wkflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(log_reg) %>% 
  add_recipe(titanic_recipe)
log_fit <- fit(log_wkflow, titanic_train)
```

```{r}
ldam_mass <- discrim_linear() %>% 
  set_engine("MASS") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")
ldam_wkflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(ldam_mass) %>% 
  add_recipe(titanic_recipe)
ldam_fit <- fit(ldam_wkflow, titanic_train)
```

```{r}
qdam_mass <- discrim_quad() %>% 
  set_engine("MASS") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")
qdam_wkflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(qdam_mass) %>% 
  add_recipe(titanic_recipe)
qdam_fit <- fit(ldam_wkflow, titanic_train)
```

How many models, total, across all folds, will you be fitting to the data? To answer, think about how many folds there are, and how many models you'll fit to each fold.

We would be fitting three models into a 10 fold cross validation that means we have 30 in total .

### Question 5

Fit each of the models created in Question 4 to the folded data.

**IMPORTANT:** *Some models may take a while to run – anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes. You should NOT re-run these models each time you knit. Instead, run them once, using an R script, and store your results; look into the use of [loading and saving](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/04/load-save-and-rda-files/). You should still include the code to run them when you knit, but set `eval = FALSE` in the code chunks.*
```{r}
tune_res_logistic <- log_wkflow %>%
fit_resamples(titanic_folds)
```

```{r}
tune_res_lda <- ldam_wkflow %>%
fit_resamples(titanic_folds)
```

```{r}
tune_res_qda <- qdam_wkflow %>%
fit_resamples(titanic_folds)
```

### Question 6

Use `collect_metrics()` to print the mean and standard errors of the performance metric *accuracy* across all folds for each of the four models.

Decide which of the 3 fitted models has performed the best. Explain why. *(Note: You should consider both the mean accuracy and its standard error.)*
```{r}
collect_metrics(tune_res_logistic)
```
```{r}
collect_metrics(tune_res_lda)
```
```{r}
collect_metrics(tune_res_qda)
```
```{r}
show_best(tune_res_logistic)
show_best(tune_res_lda)
show_best(tune_res_qda)
```
Out of all three of the models that the logistic and the qda have the similar performance in terms of both mean and standard error of the performance metric accuracy, hwoever the logistic model performs better than the qda model with the highest mean and lowest standard error. 
### Question 7

Now that you’ve chosen a model, fit your chosen model to the entire training dataset (not to the folds).
```{r}
new_log_reg <- logistic_reg() %>%
set_engine("glm") %>%
set_mode("classification")
new_log_wkflow <- workflow() %>%
add_model(new_log_reg) %>%
add_recipe(titanic_recipe)
new_log_fit <- fit(new_log_wkflow, titanic_test)
```


### Question 8

Finally, with your fitted model, use `predict()`, `bind_cols()`, and `accuracy()` to assess your model’s performance on the testing data!

Compare your model’s testing accuracy to its average accuracy across folds. Describe what you see.
```{r}
log_predict <- predict(new_log_fit, new_data = titanic_test, type = "prob")
log_accuracy<- augment(new_log_fit, new_data = titanic_train) %>%
accuracy(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)
bind_cols(log_modelpredict, log_modelaccuracy)
```
